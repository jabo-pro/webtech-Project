The purpose of the project is to develop a Spring Boot application that facilitates tea manufacturers in recording farmers and employees' information, specifically allowing registered employees to add farmer accounts and record the kilograms (KGs) of tea leaves brought in by each farmer. Additionally, the application will enable farmers to log in and view the quantity of tea leaves they have contributed and the corresponding value based on the unit price at the time of delivery.

Expected Outcomes:

User Registration: The application should provide a user registration for employees. Employees will need to create an account by providing their necessary details, such as name, email and password. Once logged in they can change their password.

Farmer Account Creation: Registered employees should have the ability to create farmer accounts. These accounts should store relevant information about the farmers, including their name, contact, photo and any other relevant information.

Tea Leaf Recording: The application should allow registered employees to record the amount of tea leaves brought in by each farmer. The employee should be able to select the corresponding farmer account and enter the KGs of tea leaves delivered.

Farmer Login: Farmers should be able to log in to the application using their credentials. Upon logging in, they should be able to view the recorded information about the tea leaves they have brought in, including the quantity and the calculated value based on the unit price at the time of delivery.


Constraints and Limitations:

User roles: The application should use spring security for user authentication. Only registered employees should have access to create farmer accounts and record tea leaf information.

Data Persistence: The application should store the recorded data securely and reliably, such as using a database management system (in this case "MySQL") for data persistence.

User Interface: The application should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both employees and farmers, ensuring ease of use and clear visibility of relevant information.

Deployment: Most deployment platforms require payment, and those that doesn't require bank card details promising not to charge anything which rose a bank account security consern.

Topic approval: Getting a unique topic that fits the set requirement was not easy and once I found one it added the next point to this list

Time: The time give (2 weeks) to implement this project and meet set requirements was not enought to meet the expected outcome considering that I have to learn new technologies to complete the project. 

The resources required for the project included:

Hardware: My PC as (a development server, a database server, and a web server).
Software: Intellij, VS Code, Xampp, Canva, HTML, CSS, Bootstap, JavaScript, Spring Boot ,Spring MVC, Spring data Jpa ,Spring Security , Thymeleaf , Mysql.

Time frame: [2 weeks]
